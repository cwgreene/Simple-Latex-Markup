p_0 = probability of heads not coming up.
This can only happen if the result is

 TT 

which has probabilty of w^2.

p_1 = probabilty of exactly one heads coming up
The combinations that will result in this are

 TH
 HT

which as a 2*w*u probabilty of occurring.

p_2 = probability of exactly two heads coming up

which can only happen with

 HH

this has probabilty of u^2 of occurring.

Since u^2=w^2, u = w (since all probabilities are positive). 
But this means that u^2=2*w*u=2*u^2, which menas u=w=0. This
is not possible since all possibilities must sum to 1. So
the three outcomes cannot have the same chance of occurring.

(a)

The area, D, of a region of point value i, where i > 0, is

D(i) = pi( (6-i)^2 - (5-i)^2 ) * pi*r^2/5^2

So the probability function is

P(i) = { A - pi r^2	i = 0
       { D(i) / A	i != 0 


(b)

Given the board is hit, then we calculate

P(i|"Board Hit") = P(i)/P("Board Hit")

Since

P("Board Hit") = pi*r^2 / A

we obtain

P(i|"Board Hit") = (D(i)/A) /(pi*r^2/A) = D(i)/(pi*r^2)

this yields finally

P(i|"Board Hit") = ((6-i)^2 - (5-i)^2)/5^2

which is the same as the probability distribution of Example 1.2.7

#1.20

I'm assuming in this problem that the question is asked at the begining of 
the week.

We think of there being 7 bins, each has equal probability of a call falling into.
We can think of there being 12 decisions, each with 7 options, giving 7^12 possibilities.
However, the order doesn't matter, so we factor out 12!
